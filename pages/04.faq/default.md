Here are some frequently asked questions about the Open Learning Commons.

Q1: How did the Open Learning Commons come about?

* A1: Our co-founders discovered their mutual interest in self-directed life-long learning and a shared desire to create community for co-learning. With the help of their friends in the [Digital Life Collective](https://diglife.com/), they began self-hosting a suite of open source tools to test their ideas about, and to experiment with, peer-to-peer learning.
 
Q2: What's with the split between the openlearning.cc domain and the diglife.coop domain?

* A2: Open sharing in a Creative Commons is important; semi-private communications amongst selected parties are also important.  Partitioning the streams of dialogues and artifacts into separate web domains clarifies the receptiveness of the original authors for reuse and derivative works based on their contributions. 

Q3: Do we have to use all of the tools?  Why not pick one tool that does everything?

* A3: In an perfect world, writers would spontaneously generate consistent, validated collections of knowledge on a technology that could be easily replicated and modified (i.e. wiki.openlearning.cc is Federated Wiki).  In the real world, members engage in collective sensemaking as they evolve their content, using tools that organize thoughts in different ways.  The toolset offered spans a variety of thinking styles in both public and semi-private forms, so each individual may find his or his own favourite.

Q4: If I author some content in a Creative Commons, can I change my mind about it later?

* A4: A Creative Commons license "[allows creators to grant permission to everyone in the world to use their work in certain ways](https://creativecommons.org/get-cc-savvy/copyright-creativecommons-are-friends/)".  The option of "[unpublishing news](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/the-trouble-with-unpublishing-the-news/390282/)" is generally considered a bad journalistic practice.  Content can, however, be annotated is revised or corrected, or deprecated with an update or superseding version in a different place.  On the Internet, critical readers recognize that content is associated with a date, and the world changes.
